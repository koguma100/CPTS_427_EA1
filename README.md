# CPTS_427_EA1

## Activity Description
The VICEROY Sentinel Watch is the second CTF of a three-part series and is a team-based event. I participated with fellow WSU students Aaron Aytes, Taylor Tran, and Kevin Kagawa. 
The event was composed of categories such as web exploitation, pwn, forensics, password cracking, and reversing. As a team, we were given a list of topics beforehand that would be 
relevant to the questions in the CTF. We then scheduled a three-hour window to participate in the event.

* I am not sure if we are allowed to share information about specific questions, so I will only describe the general concepts used.

## Technical Decisions
Through this challenge, I explored several new cybersecurity concepts using tools from Kali Linux and standard Linux utilities. For web problems, I used tools such as curl, Burp Suite, 
and Gobuster. For password cracking, I used Aircrack-ng and Hashcat. Our team’s main method of communication throughout the event was Discord, and we prepared for the event by ensuring 
that everyone had a working Kali setup before the event started.

## Personal Contributions
I was personally responsible for solving three problems in the web category. These problems involved input validation flaws, path traversal, local file inclusion, and the confused deputy problem. 
I also solved a problem in the pwn category involving unsafe cron jobs, as well as a problem in password cracking. In addition to the problems I personally solved, I assisted my teammates by 
pointing them in the right direction through advice on tools to use and by helping with their VM and Kali setups.

## Quality Assessment
I believe I personally contributed well to this event. Our team faced some technical issues at the beginning of the event, but we were able to maintain open communication and get everything 
sorted out. Our team did not score particularly high, but we had a range of skill levels, so I believe everyone on our team was able to learn new cybersecurity concepts. I personally felt that 
it was a good review of topics I already knew, and a new concept I learned through the event was how cron jobs work and how they can be exploited if configured insecurely. If I had to change something 
about how our team approached the event, I would have scheduled a meeting to review the guide given to us beforehand. I feel that if we had put that time in, we would have been better prepared to 
perform well in this event.
