# CPTS_427_EA1

## Activity Description
The VICEROY Sentinal Watch is the second CTF of a three part series, and is a team-based event. I participated with fellow WSU students, Aaron Aytes, Taylor Tran, and Kevin Kagawa.
The event was composed of categories such as web exploitation, Pwn, forensics, password cracking, and reversing. As a team, we were given a list of topics beforehand that
would be relevant to the questions in the CTF. We then scheduled a three hour window to participate in the event.

* I'm not sure if we are allowed to share information about specific questions so I will only describe the general concepts used.

## Technical Decisions
Through this challenge, I explored several new cybersecurity concepts using tools from Kali Linux and standard Linux utilities. For
web problems, I used tools such as curl, Burp Suite, and gobuster. For password cracking, I used aircrack-ng and hashcat. Our team's
main communication throughout the event was Discord, and we prepared for the event by all having a Kali setup before the event started.

## Personal Contributions
I was personally responsible for solving 3 problems in the web category. These problems involved input validation flaws, path traversal, local file inclusion, 
and the confused deputy problem. I also solved a problem in the Pwn category involving unsafe cron jobs, and a problem in password cracking.
Besides the problems I personally solved, I assisted my teammates by pointing them in the right direction through advice on tools to use and assisting with
their setup of VMs/Kali.

## Quality Assessment
I believe I personal contributed well to this event. Our team faced some technical issues in the beginning of the event but we were able to remain in open
communication and get everything sorted. Our team didn't score particularly high, but we had a range of skill levels, so I believe everyone im our team was 
able to learn new cybersecurity concepts. I personally thought it was good review with topics I knew, and a new concept I learned through the event was how 
cron jobs work and how they can be exploited if done insecurely. IF I had to change something about how our team approached the event, I would have scheduled 
a meeting beforehand to review the guide given to us beforehand. I feel like if we put that time in, we would have been better prepared to do well in this 
event.
